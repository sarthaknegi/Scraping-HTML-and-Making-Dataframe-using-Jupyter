# Scraping-HTML-and-Making-Dataframe-using-Jupyter

I have added both ipynb and html files.

Function+sec+dataframe : It scrapes data from HTML page and transforms the data into a DataFrame

Function+get_sec_zip_by_period : This takes a zip file and transforms into a DataFrame

BlackStone Managers : Parses a json file and displays the Black Stone Managers in the "345, Park Avenue, New York" area.
